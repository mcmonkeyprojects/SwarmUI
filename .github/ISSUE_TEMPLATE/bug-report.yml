                Before submitting a **Bug Report**, please ensure the following:

                **1:** You are running the latest version of SwarmUI. You can go to `Server` -> then press `Update and Restart` to update.
                **2:** You have looked at the existing bug reports and made sure this isn't already reported.
                **3:** This is an actual bug in SwarmUI, not just a support question and not caused by an extension. A bug is when you can specify exact steps to replicate what went wrong and others will be able to repeat your steps and see the same issue happen.

                If unsure, ask on the [SwarmUI Discord](https://discord.gg/q2y38cqjNw) first.
