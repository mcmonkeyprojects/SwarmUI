# Official SDXL Preset Pack

These are the presets that were used on DreamStudio (Stability AI's web generation platform) around the time that SDXL was launched to the public in 2023.

- Download this file: [SDXL Official Presets.json](https://github.com/mcmonkeyprojects/SwarmUI/releases/download/0.6.5-Beta/SDXL.Official.Presets.json) and save it somewhere (anywhere, desktop is fine)
- Open SwarmUI and open the `Presets` tab at the bottom
- Click on the `Import Presets` button
- drag the presets file in to the box that appears
- Click the `Import` button at the bottom
- close the box, look at your presets list - there is now a folder labeled `sdxlofficial` on the side. Click into that.

- You can click on any preset to use it, or unclick it to disable it.
    - (Note: if it behaves weird, refresh the page. Alpha projects do silly things sometimes!)
