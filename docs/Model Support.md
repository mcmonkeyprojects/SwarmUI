# General Info

- Swarm natively supports `.safetensors` format models with [ModelSpec](https://github.com/Stability-AI/ModelSpec) metadata
    - can also import metadata from some legacy formats used by other UIs (auto webui thumbnails, matrix jsons, etc)

# Image Models

- Image demos included below are mini-grids of seeds `1, 2, 3` of the prompt `wide shot, photo of a cat with mixed black and white fur, sitting in the middle of an open roadway, holding a cardboard sign that says "Meow I'm a Cat". In the distance behind is a green road sign that says "Model Testing Street".` ran on each model.
- For all models, "standard parameters" are used.
    - Steps is set to 20 except for Turbo models. Turbo models are ran at their standard fast steps (usually 4).
    - CFG is set appropriate to the model.
    - Resolution is model default.
- This prompt is designed to require (1) multiple complex components (2) photorealism (3) text (4) impossible actions (cat holding a sign - Most models get very confused how to do this).
- All generations are done on the base model of the relevant class, not on any finetune/lora/etc. Finetunes are likely to significantly change the qualitative capabilities, but unlikely to significantly change general ability to understand and follow prompts.
- This is not a magic perfect test prompt, just a decent coverage of range to showcase approximately what you can expect from the model in terms of understanding and handling challenges.
    - You could make a point that maybe I should have set CFG different or used a sigma value or changed up prompt phrasing or etc. and get better quality - this test intentionally uses very bland parameters to maximize identical comparison. Keep in mind that you can get better results out of a model by fiddling parameters.
- You'll note models started being able to do decently well on this test in late 2024. Older models noticeable fail at the basic requirements of this test.


## Stable Diffusion v1 and v2

![img](/docs/images/models/sd15.jpg)
*(Above image is SDv1.5)*

SDv1/SDv2 models work exactly as normal. Even legacy (pre-[ModelSpec](https://github.com/Stability-AI/ModelSpec) models are supported).

### Stable Diffusion v1 Inpainting Models

SDv1 inpaint models (RunwayML) are supported, but will work best if you manually edit the Architecture ID to be `stable-diffusion-v1/inpaint`.

Under `Init Image` param group, checkmark `Use Inpainting Encode`.

## Stable Diffusion XL

![img](/docs/images/models/sdxl.jpg)

SDXL models work as normal, with the bonus that by default enhanced inference settings will be used (eg scaled up rescond).

Additional, SDXL-Refiner architecture models can be inferenced, both as refiner or even as a base (you must manually set res to 512x512 and it will generate weird results).

## SD1 and SDXL Turbo Variants

Turbo, LCM (Latent Consistency Models), Lightning, etc. models work the same as regular models, just set `CFG Scale` to `1` and:
    - For Turbo, `Steps` to `1` Under the `Sampling` group set `Scheduler` to `Turbo`.
    - For LCM, `Steps` to `4`. Under the `Sampling` group set `Sampler` to `lcm`.
    - For lightning, (?)

## SegMind SSD-1B

SegMind SSD-1B models work the same as SD models.

## Stable Diffusion 3

![img](/docs/images/models/sd3m.jpg)

Stable Diffusion 3 Medium is supported and works as normal.

By default the first time you run an SD3 model, Swarm will download the text encoders for you.

Under the `Sampling` parameters group, a parameter named `SD3 TextEncs` is available to select whether to use CLIP, T5, or both. By default, CLIP is used (no T5) as results are near-identical but CLIP-only has much better performance, especially on systems with limited resources.

Under `Advanced Sampling`, the parameter `Sigma Shift` is available. This defaults to `3` on SD3, but you can lower it to around ~1.5 if you wish to experiment with different values. Messing with this value too much is not recommended.

For upscaling with SD3, the `Refiner Do Tiling` parameter is highly recommended (SD3 does not respond well to regular upscaling without tiling).

### Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large

![img](/docs/images/models/sd35l.jpg)

- Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large is supported and works as normal, including both normal and Turbo variants.
- The [TensorArt 3.5L TurboX](https://huggingface.co/tensorart/stable-diffusion-3.5-large-TurboX/tree/main) works too, just set `CFG Scale` to `1`, and `Steps` to `8`, and advanced `Sigma Shift` to `5`
- They behave approximately the same as the SD3 Medium models, including same settings and all, other than harsher resource requirements and better quality.
- You can also use [GGUF Versions](#gguf-quantized-models) of the models.
    - SD3.5 Large <https://huggingface.co/city96/stable-diffusion-3.5-large-gguf/tree/main> or LargeTurbo <https://huggingface.co/city96/stable-diffusion-3.5-large-turbo-gguf/tree/main>

### Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium

![img](/docs/images/models/sd35m.jpg)

- Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium is supported and works as normal.
- They behave approximately the same as the SD3 Medium models, including same settings and all.
- You can also use [GGUF Versions](#gguf-quantized-models) of the models.
    - SD3.5 Medium <https://huggingface.co/city96/stable-diffusion-3.5-medium-gguf/tree/main>
- SD 3.5 Medium support resolutions from 512x512 to 1440x1440, and the model metadata of the official model recommends 1440x1440. However, the official model is not good at this resolution. You will want to click the `â˜°` hamburger menu on a model, then `Edit Metadata`, then change the resolution to `1024x1024` for better results. You can of course set the `Aspect Ratio` parameter to `Custom` and the edit resolutions on the fly per-image.

## Stable Cascade

![img](/docs/images/models/cascade.jpg)

Stable Cascade is supported if you use the "ComfyUI Format" models (aka "All In One") https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-cascade/tree/main/comfyui_checkpoints that come as a pair of `stage_b` and `stage_c` models.

You must keep the two in the same folder, named the same with the only difference being `stage_b` vs `stage_c` in the filename.

Either model can be selected in the UI to use them, it will automatically use both.

# PixArt Sigma

![img](/docs/images/models/pixart-sigma-xl-2.jpg)
*(above image is PixArt Sigma XL 2 1024 MS)*

The [PixArt Sigma MS models](https://huggingface.co/PixArt-alpha/PixArt-Sigma/tree/main) are supported in Swarm with a few setup steps.

These steps are not friendly to beginners (if PixArt gains popularity, likely more direct/automated/native support will be added), but advanced users can follow:

- After downloading the model, run Swarm's **Utilities** -> **Pickle To Safetensors** -> `Convert Models`. You need a safetensors models for Swarm to accurately identify model type.
    - Or download a preconverted copy, like this one: https://huggingface.co/HDiffusion/Pixart-Sigma-Safetensors
- After you have a safetensors model, find it in the Models tab and click the menu button on the model and select "`Edit Metadata`"
    - From the `Architecture` dropdown, select `PixArtMS Sigma XL 2` for 1024 or lower models, or `XL 2 (2K)` for the 2k
    - In the `Standard Resolution` box, enter `1024x1024` for 1024 or `512x512` for the 512, or `2048x2048` for the 2k
- The first time you run a PixArt model, it will prompt you to install [Extra Models by City96](https://github.com/city96/ComfyUI_ExtraModels). You must accept this for PixArt models to work.
- Make sure in **User Settings**, you have a `DefaultSDXLVae` selected. If not, Swarm will autodownload a valid SDXL VAE.
- Swarm will autodownload T5XXL-EncoderOnly for you on first run (same as SD3-Medium T5-Only mode)
- You can now use the model as easily as any other model. Some feature compatibility features might arise.

# NVIDIA Sana

![img](/docs/images/models/sana-1600m.jpg)
*(above image is Nvidia Sana 1600M 1024)*

The [Nvidia Sana models](https://huggingface.co/Efficient-Large-Model/Sana_1600M_1024px) are supported in Swarm with a few setup steps.

These steps are not friendly to beginners (if Sana gains popularity, likely more direct/automated/native support will be added), but advanced users can follow:

- Recommended: use the [preconverted Sana model](https://huggingface.co/mcmonkey/sana-models/blob/main/Sana_1600M_1024px.safetensors)
- Otherwise, if you use the original 'pth' version, after downloading the model, run Swarm's **Utilities** -> **Pickle To Safetensors** -> `Convert Models`. You need a safetensors models for Swarm to accurately identify model type.
- The first time you run a Sana model, it will prompt you to install [Extra Models by City96](https://github.com/city96/ComfyUI_ExtraModels). You must accept this for Sana models to work.
- You may need to manually install pip packages: `python -s -m pip install -U transformers`, possibly also `bitsandbytes`
- Swarm will autodownload the Sana DCAE VAE for you on the first run.
- The text encoder, Gemma 2B, will also be autodownloaded (in this case by the backing comfy nodes)
- You can now use the model as easily as any other model. Some feature compatibility features might arise.
- Only Sana 1600M 1024 has been validated currently
- use a CFG around 4

# AuraFlow

![img](/docs/images/models/auraflow-02.jpg)
*(above image is AuraFlow v0.2)*

[Fal.ai's AuraFlow v0.1](https://huggingface.co/fal/AuraFlow/tree/main) and [v0.2](https://huggingface.co/fal/AuraFlow-v0.2) and v0.3 are supported in Swarm, but you must manually select architecture to use it.

Download the model, then click "`Edit Metadata`" and select `AuraFlow` as the architecture, and set resolution to `1024x1024`.

Parameters and usage is the same as any other normal model.

# Black Forest Labs' Flux.1 Models

### Flux Dev

![img](/docs/images/models/flux-dev.jpg)

### Flux Schnell

![img](/docs/images/models/flux-schnell.jpg)

### Install

- Black Forest Labs' Flux.1 model is fully supported in Swarm <https://blackforestlabs.ai/announcing-black-forest-labs/>
    - **Recommended:** use the [GGUF Format Files](#gguf-quantized-models) (best for most graphics cards)
        - Flux Schnell <https://huggingface.co/city96/FLUX.1-schnell-gguf/tree/main>
        - Flux Dev <https://huggingface.co/city96/FLUX.1-dev-gguf/tree/main>
        - `Q6_K` is best accuracy on high VRAM, but `Q4_K_S` cuts VRAM requirements while still being very close to original quality, other variants shouldn't be used normally
        - Goes in `(Swarm)/Models/diffusion_models`
        - After adding the model, refresh the list, then you may need to click the `â˜°` hamburger menu on the model, then `Edit Metadata` and set the `Architecture` to `Flux Dev` or `Flux Schnell` as relevant, unless it detects correctly on its own.
    - **Alternate:** the simplified fp8 file (best on 3090, 4090, or higher tier cards):
        - Dev <https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/flux1-dev/blob/main/flux1-dev-fp8.safetensors>
        - Schnell <https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/flux1-schnell/blob/main/flux1-schnell-fp8.safetensors>
        - goes in your regular `(Swarm)/Models/Stable-Diffusion` dir
    - **or, not recommended:** You can download BFL's original files:
        - Download "Schnell" (Turbo) from <https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-schnell>
        - Or "Dev" (non-Turbo) from <https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev>
        - Goes in `(Swarm)/Models/diffusion_models`
    - Required VAE & TextEncoders will be autodownloaded if you do not already have them, you don't need to worry about those.

### Parameters

- **CFG Scale:** For both models, use `CFG Scale` = `1` (negative prompt won't work).
    - For the Dev model, there is also a `Flux Guidance Scale` parameter under `Sampling`, which is a distilled embedding value that the model was trained to use.
    - Dev can use some slightly-higher CFG values (allowing for negative prompt), possibly higher if you reduce the Flux Guidance value and/or use Dynamic Thresholding.
- **Sampler:** Leave it at default (Euler + Simple)
- **Steps:** For Schnell use Steps=4 (or lower, it can even do 1 step), for Dev use Steps=20 or higher
- **Resolution:** It natively supports any resolution up to 2 mp (1920x1088), and any aspect ratio thereof. By default will use 1MP 1024x1024 in Swarm. You can take it down to 256x256 and still get good results.
    - You can mess with the resolution quite a lot and still get decent results. It's very flexible even past what it was trained on.
- You _can_ do a refiner upscale 2x and it will work but take a long time and might not have excellent quality.
    - Enable `Refiner Do Tiling` for any upscale target resolution above 1536x1536.

### Performance

- Flux is best on a very high end GPU (eg 4090) for now. It is a 12B model.
    - Smaller GPUs can run it, but will be slow. This requires a lot of system RAM (32GiB+). It's been shown to work as low down as an RTX 2070 or 2060 (very slowly).
- On a 4090, schnell takes about 4/5 seconds to generate a 4-step image, very close to SDXL 20 steps in time, but much higher quality.
- By default swarm will use fp8_e4m3fn for Flux, if you have a very very big GPU and want to use fp16/bf16, under `Advanced Sampling` set `Preferred DType` to `Default (16 bit)`

### Flux.1 Tools

- The Flux.1 Tools announced [here by BFL](https://blackforestlabs.ai/flux-1-tools/) are supported in SwarmUI
- For "**Redux**", a Flux form of image prompting:
    - Download [the Redux model](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-Redux-dev/blob/main/flux1-redux-dev.safetensors) to `(SwarmUI)/Models/style_models`
    - (Don't worry about sigclip, it is automanaged)
    - Drag an image to the prompt area
    - On the top left, find the `Image Prompting` parameter group
    - Select the `Use Style Model` parameter to the Redux model
    - There's an advanced `Style Model Apply Start` param to allow better structural control from your text prompt
        - set to 0.1 or 0.2 or so to have the text prompt guide structure before redux takes over styling
        - at 0, text prompt is nearly ignored
    - The advanced `Style Model Merge Strength` param lets you partial merge the style model against the nonstyled input, similar to Multiply Strength
    - The advanced `Style Model Multiply Strength` param directly multiplies the style model output, similar to Merge Strength
- For "**Canny**" / "**Depth**" models, they work like regular models (or LoRAs), but require an Init Image to function.
    - Goes in the regular `diffusion_models` or lora folder depending on which you downloaded.
    - You must input an appropriate image. So eg for the depth model, input a Depth Map.
        - You can use the controlnet parameter group to generate depth maps or canny images from regular images.
            - (TODO: Native interface to make that easier instead of janking controlnet)
    - Make sure to set Creativity to `1`.
    - This is similar in operation to Edit models.
- For "**Fill**" (inpaint model), it works like other inpaint models.
    - It's a regular model file, it goes in the regular `diffusion_models` folder same as other flux models.
    - "Edit Image" interface encouraged.
    - Mask a region and go.
    - Creativity `1` works well.
    - Larger masks recommended. Small ones may not replace content.
    - Boosting the `Flux Guidance Scale` way up to eg `30` may improve quality
- If you want to use the **ACE Plus** Models (Character consistency)
    - Download the LoRAs from https://huggingface.co/ali-vilab/ACE_Plus/tree/main and save as normal loras
    - Enable the Flux Fill model, enable the LoRA you chose
    - Set `Flux Guidance Scale` way up to `50`
    - Open an image editor for the image you want to use as an input (Drag to center area, click Edit Image)
    - set `Init Image Creativity` to 1 (max)
    - Change your `Resolution` parameters to have double the `Width` (eg 1024 input, double to 2048)
    - Add a Mask, draw a dot anywhere in the empty area (this is just a trick to tell the editor to automask all the empty area to the side, you don't need to mask it manually)
    - Type your prompt, hit generate

# Lumina 2

![img](/docs/images/models/lumina-2.png)
*(Generated with the `highest degree of image-text alignment` preprompt, CFG=4, SigmaShift=6, Steps=20)*

- Lumina 2 is an image diffusion transformer model, similar in structure to SD3/Flux/etc. rectified flow DiTs, with an LLM (Gemma 2 2B) as its input handler.
- It is a 2.6B model, similar size to SDXL or SD3.5M, much smaller than Flux or SD3.5L
- You can download the Comfy Org repackaged version of the model for use in SwarmUI here: <https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/Lumina_Image_2.0_Repackaged/blob/main/all_in_one/lumina_2.safetensors>
    - Or the `diffusion_models` variant <https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/Lumina_Image_2.0_Repackaged/blob/main/split_files/diffusion_models/lumina_2_model_bf16.safetensors> (this version will by default load in fp8, and run a bit faster on 40xx cards)
- Because of the LLM input, you have to prompt it like an LLM.
    - This means `a cat` yields terrible results, instead give it: `You are an assistant designed to generate superior images with the superior degree of image-text alignment based on textual prompts or user prompts. <Prompt Start> a cat` to get good results
    - Lumina's published reference list of prompt prefixes from [source code](https://github.com/Alpha-VLLM/Lumina-Image-2.0/blob/main/sample.py#L246):
        - `You are an assistant designed to generate high-quality images with the highest degree of image-text alignment based on textual prompts. <Prompt Start> `
        - `You are an assistant designed to generate high-quality images based on user prompts. <Prompt Start> `
        - `You are an assistant designed to generate high-quality images with highest degree of aesthetics based on user prompts. <Prompt Start> `
        - `You are an assistant designed to generate superior images with the superior degree of image-text alignment based on textual prompts or user prompts. <Prompt Start> `
        - `You are an assistant designed to generate four high-quality images with highest degree of aesthetics arranged in 2x2 grids based on user prompts. <Prompt Start> `
        - You can absolutely make up your own though.
        - For longer prompts the prefix becomes less needed.
- The model uses the Flux.1 VAE
- **Parameters:**
    - **CFG**: 4 is their base recommendation
    - **Sigma Shift:** The default is `6` per Lumina reference script, Comfy recommends `3` for use with lower step counts, so you can safely mess with this parameter if you want to. 6 seems to be generally better for structure, while 3 is better for fine details by sacrificing structure, but may have unwanted artifacts. Raising step count reduces some artifacts.
    - **Steps:** The usual 20 steps is fine, but reference Lumina script uses 250(?!) by default (it has a weird sampler that is akin to Euler at 36 steps actually supposedly?)
        - Quick initial testing shows that raising steps high doesn't work any particularly different on this model than others, but the model at SigmaShift=6 produces some noise artifacts at regular 20 steps, raising closer to 40 cuts those out.
    - **Renorm CFG:** Lumina 2 reference code sets a new advanced parameter `Renorm CFG` to 1. This is available in Swarm under `Advanced Sampling`.
        - The practical difference is subjective and hard to predict, but enabling it seems to tend towards more fine detail

# Video Models

Video models are documented in [Video Model Support](/docs/Video%20Model%20Support.md)

# Alternative Model Formats

## Bits-and-Bytes NF4 Format Models

- BnB NF4 format models, such as this copy of Flux Dev <https://huggingface.co/lllyasviel/flux1-dev-bnb-nf4/tree/main?show_file_info=flux1-dev-bnb-nf4.safetensors>, are partially supported in SwarmUI automatically.
    - The detection internally works by looking for `bitsandbytes__nf4` in the model's keys
    - The first time you try to load an NF4 model, it will give you a popup asking to install support
        - This will autoinstall https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI_bitsandbytes_NF4 which is developed by comfyanonymous and lllyasviel, and is under the AGPL license.
    - You can accept this popup, and it will install and reload the backend
    - Then try to generate again, and it should work
- Note that BnB-NF4 models have multiple compatibility limitations, including even LoRAs don't apply properly.
    - If you want a quantized flux model, GGUF is recommended instead.

## GGUF Quantized Models

- GGUF Quantized `diffusion_models` models are supported in SwarmUI automatically.
    - The detection is based on file extension.
    - They go in `(Swarm)/Models/diffusion_models` and work similar to other `diffusion_models` format models
        - Required VAE & TextEncoders will be autodownloaded if you do not already have them.
    - You will have to click the `â˜°` hamburger menu on a model, then `Edit Metadata`, and set the `Architecture:` field to the relevant correct one (it cannot be autodetected currently).
    - The first time you try to load a GGUF model, it will give you a popup asking to install support
        - This will autoinstall https://github.com/city96/ComfyUI-GGUF which is developed by city96.
    - You can accept this popup, and it will install and reload the backend
    - Then try to generate again, and it should just work

## TensorRT

- TensorRT support (`.engine`) is available for SDv1, SDv2-768-v, SDXL Base, SDXL Refiner, SVD, SD3-Medium
- TensorRT is an nvidia-specific accelerator library that provides faster SD image generation at the cost of reduced flexibility. Generally this is best for heavy usages, especially for API/Bots/etc. and less useful for regular individual usage.
- You can generate TensorRT engines from the model menu. This includes a button on-page to autoinstall TRT support your first time using it, and configuration of graph size limits and optimal scales. (TensorRT works fastest when you generate at the selected optimal resolution, and slightly less fast at any dynamic resolution outside the optimal setting.)
- Note that TensorRT is not compatible with LoRAs, ControlNets, etc.
- Note that you need to make a fresh TRT engine for any different model you want to use.
